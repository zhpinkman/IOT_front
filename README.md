IOT project for capturing fluctuations in temperature and other variables in some environment using ThingSpeak (frontend part)

---

This project was aimed to capture the fluctuations with a nodeMCU and transfer those informations by a portal. The provided dashboard can get those informations from the predefined API from the `ThingSpeak` and show them in some templates. This project was carried out in the `Digital Logic Circuits` under supervision of `Professor Navvabi`.
